[{"type": "text", "content": "# Understanding Motion\n\nMotion is a fundamental concept in physics that describes an object's change in position over time. To understand motion fully, it is important to explore what it means, the types of motion, and the methods we use to measure it.\n\n## Definition of Motion\n\nMotion occurs whenever an object changes its position with respect to a reference point. For example, if you are sitting in a car and it starts moving, your position is changing relative to the trees and buildings outside. \n\nWe define motion mathematically through displacement, which refers to the change in position of an object. The formula for displacement can be written as:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": "\n\\Delta x = x_f - x_i\n"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta x\\) is the displacement,\n- \\(x_f\\) is the final position of the object,\n- \\(x_i\\) is the initial position of the object.\n\n### Example: \n\nIf you walk from a point 3 meters to the right of your starting position (let this be your initial position), your final position would be at 3 meters. Thus,\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": "\n\\Delta x = 3\\,m - 0\\,m = 3\\,m\n"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n## Types of Motion\n\n1. **Straight-Line Motion**:\n    - This is the simplest type of motion where an object moves in a straight path. \n    - Examples of straight-line motion include a car driving along a straight road or a person walking in a straight line.\n\n    When an object moves in a straight line, we can describe it using distance and displacement. While distance is the total path covered regardless of direction, displacement is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position.\n\n2. **Circular Motion**:\n    - When an object moves along a circular path, it is said to be in circular motion. \n    - Examples include a car going round a circular track or a satellite orbiting Earth.\n\n    In circular motion, even if an object travels around a circle at a constant speed, its direction is continually changing, which means it\u2019s accelerating towards the center of the circle. This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration and can be expressed as:\n\n    "}, {"type": "latex", "content": "\n    a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}\n    "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n    Where:\n    - \\(a_c\\) is the centripetal acceleration,\n    - \\(v\\) is the linear speed of the object,\n    - \\(r\\) is the radius of the circular path.\n\n### Example:\nIf a car travels around a circular track with a radius of 50 meters at a speed of 10 meters per second, the centripetal acceleration can be calculated as:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": "\na_c = \\frac{(10\\,m/s)^2}{50\\,m} = \\frac{100\\,m^2/s^2}{50\\,m} = 2\\,m/s^2\n"}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n## Measuring Motion with Distance and Time\n\nTo quantify motion, we rely on distance, time, and speed.
