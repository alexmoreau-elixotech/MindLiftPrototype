[{"type": "text", "content": "# Fundamental Concepts of Mechanics\n\nMechanics is a branch of physics that studies the motion of objects and the forces that cause or change that motion. Understanding mechanics is essential for analyzing how objects interact and behave under different conditions. In this section, we will discuss three fundamental concepts: motion, forces, and energy.\n\n## 1. Motion\n\nMotion refers to the change in position of an object over time. It can be described in terms of several key parameters: displacement, velocity, and acceleration.\n\n### 1.1 Displacement\n\nDisplacement is a vector quantity that refers to the shortest distance from an initial position to a final position, along with the direction of that distance. For example, if an object moves from point A (0, 0) to point B (3, 4) in a two-dimensional plane, the displacement can be calculated using the formula:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " \\text{Displacement} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta x\\) is the change in the x-direction (3 - 0 = 3)\n- \\(\\Delta y\\) is the change in the y-direction (4 - 0 = 4)\n\nThus,\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " \\text{Displacement} = \\sqrt{(3)^2 + (4)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nSo, the displacement from point A to point B is 5 units in the direction from A to B.\n\n### 1.2 Velocity\n\nVelocity is the rate at which an object changes its position. It is also a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. If an object travels a displacement \\( d \\) in a time \\( t \\), its average velocity \\( v \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " v = \\frac{d}{t} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nFor instance, if a car travels 100 kilometers in 2 hours, its average velocity would be:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " v = \\frac{100 \\text{ km}}{2 \\text{ h}} = 50 \\text{ km/h} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n### 1.3 Acceleration\n\nAcceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time. It tells us how quickly an object is speeding up or slowing down. If an object\u2019s velocity changes from \\( v_0 \\) to \\( v \\) over a time interval \\( t \\), the average acceleration \\( a \\) is given by:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " a = \\frac{v - v_0}{t} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nFor example, if a car speeds up from 20 km/h to 60 km/h in 5 seconds, the acceleration is calculated as:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " a = \\frac{60 \\text{ km/h} - 20 \\text{ km/h}}{5 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{40 \\text{ km/h}}{5 \\text{ s}} = 8 \\text{ km/h/s} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n## 2. Forces\n\nForces are pushes or pulls that can cause an object to accelerate. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. This relationship is expressed with the formula:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " F = m \\cdot a "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nWhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the force in newtons (N)\n- \\( m \\) is the mass in kilograms (kg)\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2)\n\n### 2.1 Types of Forces\n\n1. **Contact Forces:** These require physical contact between objects, such as friction, tension, and normal force.\n2. **Non-contact Forces:** These act at a distance. Examples include gravitational force, magnetic force, and electrostatic force.\n\n### Example\n\nIf a cart has a mass of 10 kg and is accelerating at 2 m/s\u00b2, you can find the force applied on the cart:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " F = m \\cdot a = 10 \\text{ kg} \\cdot 2 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 20 \\text{ N} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n## 3. Energy\n\nEnergy is the capacity to do work, and it exists in various forms such as kinetic energy and potential energy. \n\n### 3.1 Kinetic Energy\n\nKinetic energy (KE) is the energy of an object in motion. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " KE = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the object\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of the object\n\nFor example, a car with a mass of 1000 kg moving at a speed of 15 m/s has a kinetic energy of:\n\n"}, {"type": "latex", "content": " KE = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1000 \\text{ kg} \\cdot (15 \\text{ m/s})^2 = 0.5 \\cdot 1000 \\cdot 225 = 112500 \\text{ J} "}, {"type": "text", "content": "\n\n### 3.2 Potential Energy\n\nPotential energy (PE) is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration.
