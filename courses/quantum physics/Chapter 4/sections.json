{"Section 1": {"title": "Quantization", "description": "This section introduces the idea that energy and matter exist in discrete units, or quanta, rather than in a continuous fashion. Students will learn how this concept emerged and its implications for the understanding of physical phenomena."}, "Section 2": {"title": "Wave-Particle Duality", "description": "In this section, students will explore the dual nature of light and matter, examining the evidence that supports the idea that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Simple experiments, such as the double-slit experiment, will be discussed."}, "Section 3": {"title": "The Uncertainty Principle", "description": "This section covers Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, explaining its significance in quantum mechanics and how it affects our understanding of measurements at the atomic and subatomic levels. Real-world implications of uncertainty will also be highlighted."}, "Section 4": {"title": "Quantum States and Superposition", "description": "Students will learn about quantum states and the principle of superposition, which allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This section will also introduce foundational concepts like wave functions."}, "Section 5": {"title": "Entanglement", "description": "In this section, the concept of quantum entanglement will be introduced, explaining how particles can become linked in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance separating them."}}
